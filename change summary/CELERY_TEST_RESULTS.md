## ‚úÖ Verification Tests

### 1. Celery Worker Communication
```bash
$ docker-compose exec celery_worker celery -A config inspect ping
->  celery@bfee50673d08: OK
        pong

1 node online.
```
**Result:** ‚úÖ PASS

### 2. Registered Tasks
All 4 tasks successfully registered:
- ‚úÖ `simulation.run_energyplus_batch` - Main simulation task
- ‚úÖ `simulation.cleanup_old_results` - Cleanup periodic task
- ‚úÖ `simulation.health_check` - Health monitoring task
- ‚úÖ `config.celery.debug_task` - Debug task

**Result:** ‚úÖ PASS

### 3. Redis Connection
```
Connected to redis://redis:6379/0
```
**Result:** ‚úÖ PASS

### 4. Backend API Health
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8000/api/simulation/system-resources/
```
Response includes:
- CPU: 14 cores, ~31% usage
- Memory: 7.65 GB total, 4.57 GB available
- EnergyPlus Docker: Available and working (v23.2.0)

**Result:** ‚úÖ PASS

### 5. Database Migrations
```bash
$ docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
Applying simulation.0006_auto_20251001_1132... OK
```
‚úÖ Added `celery_task_id` field to Simulation model

**Result:** ‚úÖ PASS

## üîß What Was Fixed

During testing, we discovered:

1. **Issue:** Large Docker build context (3.44GB) causing slow builds
   - **Fix:** Created `.dockerignore` file to exclude media files and results
   - **Result:** Build context reduced to 58KB

2. **Issue:** Celery import error when starting services
   - **Fix:** Made Celery import conditional with try/except in `__init__.py`
   - **Result:** Services start cleanly even during initial setup

3. **Issue:** Needed to rebuild Docker images with Celery dependencies
   - **Fix:** Ran `docker-compose build --no-cache backend`
   - **Result:** All dependencies installed successfully

## üìù Key Improvements

### Before (Threading)
- ‚ùå No task queue
- ‚ùå Simulations block Django process  
- ‚ùå No visibility into running tasks
- ‚ùå Hard to scale workers

### After (Celery)
- ‚úÖ Task queue with Redis broker
- ‚úÖ Non-blocking async execution
- ‚úÖ Full task monitoring and status
- ‚úÖ Horizontal scaling ready
- ‚úÖ 4 concurrent workers
- ‚úÖ Automatic retry capability
- ‚úÖ Task time limits and cleanup

## üöÄ Next Steps for Production

1. **Test Simulation Workflow**
   - Upload IDF and weather files via UI
   - Start a simulation
   - Monitor task progress
   - Verify results are saved

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with multiple concurrent simulations
   - Monitor worker memory usage
   - Adjust concurrency if needed

3. **Monitoring Setup** (Optional)
   - Install Celery Flower for web UI
   - Set up logging aggregation
   - Configure alerts for failed tasks

4. **Production Configuration**
   - Review task time limits
   - Configure result retention
   - Set up periodic cleanup tasks
   - Add task priorities if needed

- **Full Guide:** `docs/CELERY_MIGRATION.md`
- **Quick Reference:** `CELERY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- **Summary:** `CELERY_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`

## üéâ Conclusion

The Celery migration is **complete and functional**. All services are communicating properly, tasks are registered, and the system is ready for simulation testing.

**Migration Status:** ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFUL**

### Access Points

- **Frontend:** http://localhost:5173

## Latest Update - October 1, 2025 (Chord Pattern Fix)

### Critical Issue Found & Fixed ‚úÖ

**Test Simulation**: `ff62efef-1db8-4c49-8432-32c4c80e4826`

#### Issue: All Variants Failing with AttributeError
**Error**: `'FakeFileWrapper' object has no attribute 'file_path'`  
**Impact**: All 35 variant tasks completed but failed to process results  
**Logs**: Worker showed "succeeded" but with failed status

**Root Cause**:
- `FakeFileWrapper` class missing attributes expected by `process_file_results()`
- Specifically: `file_path`, `original_name`, `file_name`

**Fix Applied** (`backend/simulation/tasks.py` line 135-141):
```python
class FakeFileWrapper:
    def __init__(self, path):
        self.file = type('File', (), {'path': path, 'name': Path(path).name})()
        self.file_path = path  # ADDED
        self.original_name = Path(path).name  # ADDED
        self.file_name = Path(path).name  # ADDED
```

**Validation**: Worker restarted successfully ‚úÖ

### Architecture Validation ‚úÖ

**Chord Pattern Working Correctly**:
1. ‚úÖ Parent task dispatched 35 variant tasks
2. ‚úÖ 4 workers processed variants in parallel
3. ‚úÖ Chord callback `aggregate_batch_results` fired after all completed
4. ‚úÖ No blocking `result.get()` calls
5. ‚úÖ Task distribution working properly

**Logs Confirm**:
```
[INFO] Task simulation.run_single_variant[...] received (√ó35)
[INFO] Task simulation.run_single_variant[...] succeeded (√ó35)
[INFO] Task simulation.aggregate_batch_results[...] received
[INFO] Task simulation.aggregate_batch_results[...] succeeded
[INFO] Batch simulation completed with 35 results
```

### Next Test Run

**Status**: Ready for full end-to-end test ‚úÖ

**Expected Results**:
- 35 variants process successfully
- Results saved to PostgreSQL database
- `/parallel-results/` API returns 35 result objects
- Completion time: ~2-3 minutes (~4x faster than threading)
- Frontend displays all results

**Quick Test**:
```bash
# Run new simulation from frontend, then verify:
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py shell -c \
  "from simulation.models import Simulation, SimulationResult; \
   sim = Simulation.objects.latest('created_at'); \
   print(f'Status: {sim.status}, Progress: {sim.progress}%'); \
   print(f'Results: {SimulationResult.objects.filter(simulation_id=sim.id).count()}')"
```
