# Configuration Cleanup Progress Report

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Quick Wins Implemented - Full Cleanup In Progress  
**Next Actions:** Remove hardcoded paths, reorganize scripts

---

## ✅ What Has Been Completed

### 1. Comprehensive Cleanup Plan
**File:** `CLEANUP_PLAN.md`

**Created:**
- Complete analysis of current configuration problems
- Identified 7 major issues with specific examples
- Designed complete solution with 10 implementation phases
- Timeline estimates and risk mitigation strategies
- Quick wins list for immediate action

**Key Problems Documented:**
- Hardcoded paths (`/Users/ssanjay/GitHub/epsm`)
- Environment file chaos (multiple overlapping .env files)
- 19 scripts with overlapping functionality
- Production values in dev configs
- No staging environment
- Poor secrets management

### 2. New Environment Structure
**Created Directory:** `environments/`

**Files Created:**
1. `environments/README.md` - Complete guide to environment management
2. `environments/development.env.example` - Clean dev template with safe defaults
3. `environments/staging.env.example` - Staging environment template
4. `environments/production.env.example` - Production template with security checklist

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Clear separation of dev/staging/production
- ✅ Comprehensive inline documentation
- ✅ Security checklists for production
- ✅ No hardcoded machine-specific paths
- ✅ Proper secret placeholders with generation instructions
- ✅ Support for `.env.local` developer overrides

### 3. Updated .gitignore
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Properly ignore `.env.local` and all variants
- ✅ Allow `environments/*.example` files
- ✅ Allow environment templates
- ✅ Better organization and comments

### 4. Environment Loading Strategy Defined
**Priority Order:**

**Development:**
1. `.env.local` (developer personal settings) - highest priority
2. `.env` (team shared dev settings)
3. `environments/development.env.example` (defaults)

**Production:**
1. `.env.production` (server-specific)
2. `environments/production.env.example` (defaults)

## 🚧 What Still Needs to Be Done

### Immediate (Quick Wins)

#### 1. Remove Hardcoded Paths from Docker Compose
**File:** `docker-compose.yml`

**Current Problem:**
```yaml
HOST_MEDIA_ROOT: "/Users/ssanjay/GitHub/epsm/backend/media"  # Line 51
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS: "http://localhost:5173,http://frontend:5173,https://epsm.chalmers.se"  # Line 50
```

**Fix Needed:**
```yaml
# Option 1: Use PWD variable
HOST_MEDIA_ROOT: "${PWD}/backend/media"

# Option 2: Remove entirely and rely on Docker volumes
# volumes:
#   - media_data_dev:/app/media

# CORS: Remove production domain from dev config
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS: "http://localhost:5173,http://frontend:5173"
```

#### 2. Remove Hardcoded Paths from Production Compose
**File:** `docker-compose.production.yml`

**Current Problem:**
```yaml
HOST_MEDIA_ROOT=/var/lib/docker/volumes/epsm_media_data_prod/_data
```

**Fix Needed:**
```yaml
# Make it configurable via .env or remove if not needed
HOST_MEDIA_ROOT=${HOST_MEDIA_ROOT:-/var/lib/docker/volumes/epsm_media_data_prod/_data}
```

#### 3. Remove Production Domain from Dev CORS
**File:** `docker-compose.yml` (Line 50)

**Current:**
```yaml
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS: "http://localhost:5173,http://frontend:5173,https://epsm.chalmers.se"
```

**Should Be:**
```yaml
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS: "http://localhost:5173,http://frontend:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173"
```

### Medium Priority (Script Organization)

#### 4. Reorganize Scripts Directory
**Current State:** 19 scripts in flat structure

**Proposed Structure:**
```
scripts/
  ├── README.md                # Documentation
  ├── Core (Essential - 7 scripts)
  │   ├── start.sh
  │   ├── stop.sh
  │   ├── restart.sh
  │   ├── status.sh
  │   ├── test.sh
  │   ├── backup.sh
  │   └── restore.sh
  │
  ├── dev/                     # Development tools
  │   ├── setup-dev.sh
  │   ├── reset-dev.sh
  │   └── seed-database.sh
  │
  ├── production/              # Production tools
  │   └── deploy-production.sh
  │
  └── archive/                 # Old migration scripts
      ├── migrate-to-celery.sh
      ├── migrate-to-streamlined.sh
      ├── cleanup_and_rebuild.sh
      ├── deploy-localhost-fix.sh
      └── verify_local_db.sh
```

**Scripts to Archive:**
- `migrate-to-celery.sh` - Migration complete
- `migrate-to-streamlined.sh` - Migration complete
- `deploy-localhost-fix.sh` - One-time fix applied
- `cleanup_and_rebuild.sh` - Superseded by release.sh
- `verify_local_db.sh` - Dev testing only

**Scripts to Consolidate:**
- `check-database-health.sh` → Merge into `status.sh`
- `fix_db_permissions.sh` → Move to troubleshooting docs or dev/

#### 5. Update start.sh for New Environment Structure
**Needed Changes:**
1. Check for `.env.local` first, then `.env`
2. Offer to copy from `environments/development.env.example` if missing
3. Update instructions to reference new structure
4. Remove hardcoded path references

#### 6. Create scripts/README.md
Document:
- Purpose of each script
- When to use which script
- Development vs production scripts
- Script organization rationale

### Longer Term (Refactoring)

#### 7. Split Django Settings
**Current:** `backend/config/settings.py` or `backend/config/settings/production.py`

**Proposed:**
```
backend/config/settings/
  ├── __init__.py           # Smart loader based on DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
  ├── base.py               # Shared settings
  ├── development.py        # Dev overrides (DEBUG=True, etc.)
  ├── staging.py            # Staging overrides
  └── production.py         # Production overrides (security hardening)
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- No production values in dev settings
- Easier to maintain and understand
- Standard Django pattern

#### 8. Create Secrets Management Documentation
**File:** `docs/SECRETS_MANAGEMENT.md`

**Should Include:**
- How to generate secrets (commands provided)
- Where secrets go in each environment
- How to rotate secrets
- GitHub Actions secrets setup
- Secret audit checklist
- Emergency secret rotation procedure
- `.env.local` pattern for developers

#### 9. Update Main Documentation
**Files to Update:**
- `README.md` - Reference new environment structure
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Update setup instructions
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Update deployment process
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Update for new developers

**Add References to:**
- New `environments/` directory
- `.env.local` pattern
- Updated script organization
- Secrets management

#### 10. Consolidate Change Summary Files
**Current:** 67 markdown files in `change summary/`

**Proposed:**
```
docs/
  ├── CHANGELOG.md                 # Version-by-version changes
  ├── ARCHITECTURE.md              # System design
  ├── TROUBLESHOOTING.md           # Common issues
  └── history/                     # Historical context
      ├── 2024-10/
      ├── 2024-11/
      └── 2025-10/
          ├── celery-migration.md
          ├── saml-implementation.md
          └── deployment-fixes.md
```

- [ ] No hardcoded machine-specific paths anywhere
- [ ] `.env.local` overrides work correctly
- [ ] Development environment works with new structure
- [ ] Production config can be tested locally (dry run)
- [ ] All core scripts execute successfully
- [ ] Documentation matches actual implementation
- [ ] New developer can understand config in <30 min
- [ ] Secrets properly managed and documented
- [ ] Git history clean (no exposed secrets)

## 📝 Notes

### Why This Approach?

**Environment Templates:**
- Having separate `environments/` directory keeps examples organized
- Clear naming prevents confusion (development.env.example vs production.env.example)
- Inline documentation makes templates self-explanatory
- Security checklists reduce deployment errors

**Script Organization:**
- Flat directory with 19 scripts is confusing
- Grouping by purpose (dev/production/archive) improves discoverability
- Archiving completed migrations reduces clutter
- README provides central documentation

**Settings Split:**
- Standard Django pattern used by most projects
- Prevents accidental production values in dev
- Makes environment-specific configs obvious
- Easier to maintain and audit

### Potential Issues

**Migration Risk:**
- Existing deployments need careful migration
- Production secrets must be preserved
- Team needs notification of changes

**Mitigation:**
- Created comprehensive migration guide
- Old structure documented in archive
- Step-by-step checklist provided
- Can maintain both structures temporarily

---

## 🚀 Success Criteria

We'll know this cleanup is successful when:

1. ✅ New developer can start in 5 minutes
2. ✅ No confusion about which .env file to use
3. ✅ Production deployment is confident and repeatable
4. ✅ No hardcoded machine-specific values
5. ✅ Scripts are organized and discoverable
6. ✅ Documentation is clear and comprehensive
7. ✅ Secrets are properly managed
8. ✅ Can test production config without deploying

## Quick Reference

### For Developers (Now)
```bash
# Start development
./scripts/start.sh

# Create personal overrides (optional)
cp environments/development.env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your settings
```

### For Developers (After Full Cleanup)
```bash
# First time setup
git clone <repo>
cd epsm
./scripts/dev/setup-dev.sh  # Auto-creates .env from template

# Personal overrides
vim .env.local  # Takes precedence over .env

# Start
./scripts/start.sh
```

### For Production (Now)
```bash
# On server
cp .env.production.example /opt/epsm/.env.production
# Edit with production values
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

### For Production (After Full Cleanup)
```bash
# On server
cp environments/production.env.example /opt/epsm/.env.production
# Edit with production values
