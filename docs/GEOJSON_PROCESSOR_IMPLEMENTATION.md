# GeoJSON Processor Service - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Created a new Django service (`geojson_processor`) that integrates DTCC (Digital Twin Cities Centre) library with the EPSM application to automatically generate EnergyPlus IDF files from geographic area selections.

## What Was Built

### 1. Backend Django App: `geojson_processor`

**Location:** `/backend/geojson_processor/`

**Files Created:**
- `__init__.py` - App initialization
- `apps.py` - Django app configuration
- `dtcc_service.py` - DTCC library wrapper for downloading building data
- `geojson_to_idf.py` - Complete conversion pipeline from GeoJSON to IDF using Ladybug Tools
- `views.py` - API endpoints
- `urls.py` - URL routing

### 2. Dependencies Added

**Added to `backend/requirements.txt`:**
```
dtcc-builder
geopandas
ladybug-geometry
ladybug-core
dragonfly-core
dragonfly-energy
honeybee-core
honeybee-energy
honeybee-energy-standards
pyproj
```

### 3. API Endpoints

**POST `/api/process-geojson/`**
- Accepts geographic bounds (north, south, east, west) in WGS84 (EPSG:4326)
- Converts bounds to SWEREF99 TM (EPSG:3006) for Swedish coordinate system
- Downloads building footprints and pointcloud using DTCC
- Generates LOD1 building models
- Converts to GeoJSON, enriches with metadata
- Converts to EnergyPlus IDF format
- Returns paths to generated IDF and GeoJSON files

**Payload Example:**
```json
{
  "bounds": {
    "north": 62.0,
    "south": 61.9,
    "east": 15.1,
    "west": 15.0
  },
  "filter_height_min": 3,
  "filter_height_max": 100,
  "filter_area_min": 100,
  "use_multiplier": false
}
```

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "IDF files generated successfully",
  "idf_path": "geojson_processing/uuid/city.idf",
  "geojson_path": "geojson_processing/uuid/city_enriched.geojson",
  "work_dir": "geojson_processing/uuid",
  "idf_url": "/media/geojson_processing/uuid/city.idf",
  "geojson_url": "/media/geojson_processing/uuid/city_enriched.geojson"
}
```

**GET `/api/health/`**
- Health check endpoint
- Reports availability of DTCC and Ladybug Tools

### 4. Frontend Integration

**Modified:** `frontend/src/components/selectarea/SelectAreaPage.tsx`

**Added Features:**
- Processing dialog with status updates
- Error handling and display
- Calls `process-geojson` API when "Fetch Area" button is clicked
- Shows progress: "Downloading building footprints from DTCC..." → "IDF files generated successfully!"
- Prepared for navigation to baseline page (commented placeholder)

**User Flow:**
1. User draws rectangle or polygon on map
2. Clicks "Fetch Area" button
3. Processing dialog shows with progress updates
4. Upon success, IDF files are generated and stored in `media/geojson_processing/`
5. User can then use these files in baseline simulations

### 5. Service Architecture

**DTCCService (`dtcc_service.py`):**
- `download_city_data()` - Downloads building footprints and pointcloud for specified bounds
- Uses DTCC library to:
  - Download footprints
  - Download pointcloud
  - Build terrain mesh
  - Build LOD1 buildings
  - Export to GeoJSON

**GeoJSONToIDFConverter (`geojson_to_idf.py`):**
- `filter_buildings()` - Filters buildings by height and area
- `enrich_geojson()` - Adds metadata (building properties, stories, window ratios)
- `convert_to_idf()` - Full Dragonfly → Honeybee → IDF pipeline
- `_adjust_building_properties()` - Sets construction sets, program types, HVAC systems
- `process()` - Complete pipeline: filter → enrich → convert

**Building Type Mapping:**
Maps Swedish building categories (from DTCC) to DOE building types:
- Residential → HighriseApartment/MidriseApartment
- Industrial → Warehouse/Laboratory
- Public → Schools/Hospitals/Offices
- Default → HighriseApartment

### 6. Configuration

**Settings Updated:**
- Added `'geojson_processor'` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `backend/config/settings.py`
- Registered URLs in `backend/config/urls.py`

**File Storage:**
- Generated files stored in: `media/geojson_processing/<uuid>/`
- Includes: `city.geojson`, `city_filtered.geojson`, `city_enriched.geojson`, `city.idf`, `city.dfjson`

## How It Works

### Complete Pipeline:

```
Frontend Map
  ↓ (user draws area)
SelectAreaPage
  ↓ (click "Fetch Area")
POST /api/process-geojson/
  ↓
1. Convert WGS84 → SWEREF99 TM (EPSG:4326 → EPSG:3006)
  ↓
2. DTCCService.download_city_data()
   - Download footprints
   - Download pointcloud
   - Build terrain
   - Build LOD1 buildings
   - Export to city.geojson
  ↓
3. GeoJSONToIDFConverter.filter_buildings()
   - Remove buildings < 3m or > 100m height
   - Remove buildings < 100m² area
   - Save to city_filtered.geojson
  ↓
4. GeoJSONToIDFConverter.enrich_geojson()
   - Add project metadata
   - Calculate number of stories
   - Add window-to-wall ratio
   - Set building status
   - Save to city_enriched.geojson
  ↓
5. GeoJSONToIDFConverter.convert_to_idf()
   - Create Dragonfly Model from GeoJSON
   - Adjust building properties:
     * Set construction sets (by climate zone, type, year)
     * Set program types (based on building category)
     * Add ideal air HVAC systems
     * Set window parameters
   - Convert to Honeybee Model
   - Generate IDF file (city.idf)
   - Save Dragonfly JSON (city.dfjson)
  ↓
Return paths to generated files
  ↓
Frontend displays success
  ↓
(Next: Navigate to baseline to use generated IDF)
```

## Key Features

### 1. Coordinate System Handling
- Frontend map uses WGS84 (EPSG:4326) - standard lat/lon
- Swedish data requires SWEREF99 TM (EPSG:3006)
- Automatic conversion using `pyproj.Transformer`

### 2. Building Filtering
- Height filters: 3m - 100m (removes unrealistic buildings)
- Area filter: >= 100m² (removes small structures)
- Configurable via API parameters

### 3. Building Enrichment
- Automatically calculates number of stories
- Assigns window-to-wall ratios
- Maps Swedish building categories to energy program types
- Sets ground height for terrain following

### 4. Energy Model Generation
- Uses Honeybee Energy Standards for construction sets
- Assigns DOE commercial building program types
- Adds ideal air HVAC systems
- Sets window parameters (height, sill height, spacing)
- Generates simulation-ready IDF files

### 5. Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks at every step
- Detailed logging
- User-friendly error messages
- Health check endpoint for diagnostics

## Next Steps (Not Yet Implemented)

1. **Automatic Baseline Creation:**
   - Currently generates IDF but doesn't auto-create baseline entry
   - Need to modify to automatically call baseline creation endpoint

2. **Navigation:**
   - Frontend shows success but doesn't navigate to baseline
   - Add React Router navigation: `navigate('/baseline')`

3. **File Association:**
   - Associate generated IDF with user account
   - Add to baseline history

4. **Progress Streaming:**
   - Currently shows generic "Downloading..." message
   - Could use WebSocket for real-time DTCC download progress

5. **EPW Selection:**
   - Need weather file for simulation
   - Could auto-select nearest EPW based on bounds
   - Or prompt user to upload/select EPW

6. **Validation:**
   - Validate generated IDF before returning
   - Check for common issues
   - Provide warnings if needed

7. **Caching:**
   - Cache DTCC downloads for same area
   - Avoid re-downloading if bounds overlap

8. **Batch Processing:**
   - Support multiple areas
   - Parallel processing

## Testing

To test the service:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Check health:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/
   ```

3. **Test from frontend:**
   - Go to Select Area page
   - Draw a rectangle over Sweden
   - Click "Fetch Area"
   - Watch progress dialog

4. **Test API directly:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/process-geojson/ \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "bounds": {
         "north": 57.71,
         "south": 57.70,
         "east": 11.98,
         "west": 11.97
       }
     }'
   ```

5. **Check generated files:**
   ```bash
   ls backend/media/geojson_processing/
   ```

## Files Modified

**Backend:**
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Added dependencies
- `backend/config/settings.py` - Registered app
- `backend/config/urls.py` - Added routes
- `backend/geojson_processor/` - New app (all files)

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/src/components/selectarea/SelectAreaPage.tsx` - API integration

## Configuration Constants

**In `geojson_to_idf.py`:**
```python
DEFAULT_CLIMATE_ZONE = 'ClimateZone6'  # For Sweden
DEFAULT_CONSTRUCTION_TYPE = 'Mass'
DEFAULT_YEAR = 2000
FLOOR_TO_FLOOR_HEIGHT = 2.8  # meters
WINDOW_TO_WALL_RATIO = 0.4
WINDOW_HEIGHT = 1.6  # meters
WINDOW_SILL_HEIGHT = 0.7  # meters
WINDOW_TO_WINDOW_HORIZONTAL_SPACING = 4  # meters
ADD_DEFAULT_IDEAL_AIR = True
```

These can be made configurable via API parameters if needed.

## Known Limitations

1. **DTCC Data Availability:**
   - DTCC service may not have data for all areas
   - Depends on Swedish building registry
   - May fail for areas outside Sweden

2. **Processing Time:**
   - Large areas take time to process
   - DTCC downloads can be slow
   - No timeout handling yet

3. **Memory Usage:**
   - Large areas with many buildings use significant memory
   - May need chunking for very large areas

4. **Building Detail:**
   - LOD1 models are simple boxes
   - No detailed geometry
   - No roof shapes

5. **EPW Requirement:**
   - Generated IDF needs weather file
   - Not included in this service
   - User must provide separately
