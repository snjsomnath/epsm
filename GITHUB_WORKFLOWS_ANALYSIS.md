# GitHub Workflows Analysis

## 📋 Current Workflows

You have **3 GitHub Actions workflows** configured:

### 1. `deploy-production.yml` - Automated Production Deployment

**Trigger:** Push to `main` branch (excluding docs) or manual dispatch

**What it does:**
- ✅ Validates required secrets (PROD_HOST, PROD_USER, PROD_SSH_KEY)
- ✅ Performs network diagnostics
- ✅ SSHs into production VM
- ✅ Pulls latest code
- ✅ Uses `docker-compose.production.yml` (pre-built images)
- ✅ Cleans up Docker system

**Status:** 🟡 **CONFIGURED FOR FUTURE USE**

**Current Issue:**
- Uses `docker-compose.production.yml` which requires pre-built images from ghcr.io
- Depends on `docker-publish.yml` to build images first

**Recommendation:**
- ⏭️ Keep as-is for future automated deployments
- ⏭️ First do manual deployment with `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- ⏭️ Set up GitHub secrets later when ready for automation

---

### 2. `docker-publish.yml` - Build and Push Docker Images

**Trigger:** Push to `main`/`development`, tags, PRs, or manual dispatch

**What it does:**
- ✅ Builds backend Docker image
- ✅ Builds frontend Docker image
- ✅ Pushes to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
- ✅ Multi-platform support (amd64, arm64)
- ✅ Tags images with branch/version/SHA
- ✅ Provides deployment instructions

**Status:** ✅ **READY TO USE**

**Images created:**
- `ghcr.io/snjsomnath/epsm-backend:latest`
- `ghcr.io/snjsomnath/epsm-frontend:latest`

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ This workflow works and builds images automatically
- ✅ Images are available for `docker-compose.production.yml`
- ⏭️ Use this in the future for automated deployments

---

### 3. `release.yml` - Create GitHub Releases

**Trigger:** Version tags (v*.*.*) like v0.2.2, v1.0.0

**What it does:**
- ✅ Validates VERSION file matches tag
- ✅ Extracts changelog from CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ Creates GitHub release
- ✅ Builds and pushes Docker images with version tags
- ✅ Multi-platform builds (amd64, arm64)

**Status:** ✅ **READY TO USE**

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ Use for versioned releases
- ✅ Automatically builds tagged images
- ✅ Creates proper GitHub releases

---

## 🎯 Deployment Strategy Summary

### Current Situation:

You have **TWO deployment paths**:

#### Path 1: Manual Deployment (RECOMMENDED FOR NOW) ⭐
```bash
# On VM, build from source
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ No GitHub secrets needed
- ✅ Build directly from source
- ✅ Full control
- ✅ Best for initial deployment

**Cons:**
- ⏱️ Longer build time (~5-10 minutes)
- 🔧 Manual process

---

#### Path 2: Automated Deployment (FUTURE)
```bash
# Triggered by GitHub Actions
# Uses pre-built images from ghcr.io
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

**Pros:**
- ⚡ Fast deployment (~1 minute)
- 🤖 Automated via GitHub Actions
- 🏷️ Version-tagged images

**Cons:**
- 🔑 Requires GitHub secrets setup
- 🔐 Requires SSH access from GitHub runners
- 🌐 Depends on ghcr.io availability

---

## 🔧 Workflow Configuration Status

### Required GitHub Secrets (for automated deployment):

| Secret | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `PROD_HOST` | VM hostname (epsm.ita.chalmers.se) | ⏳ Not set |
| `PROD_USER` | SSH username (ssanjay) | ⏳ Not set |
| `PROD_SSH_KEY` | Private SSH key for VM access | ⏳ Not set |

**To set secrets:**
1. Go to GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add each secret above

---

## 📊 Workflow Analysis

### ✅ What's Working:

1. **`docker-publish.yml`** - Builds images automatically on push
2. **`release.yml`** - Creates releases on version tags
3. Both workflows push images to ghcr.io successfully

### 🟡 What Needs Configuration:

1. **`deploy-production.yml`** needs GitHub secrets:
   - PROD_HOST
   - PROD_USER  
   - PROD_SSH_KEY

2. **Network access** from GitHub runners to VM:
   - GitHub runners may not reach VM (firewall)
   - Workflow includes network diagnostics to check

### ⚠️ Potential Issues:

#### Issue 1: GitHub Runners Can't Reach VM
**Problem:** Chalmers VM may block GitHub's runner IPs

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Use self-hosted runner on Chalmers network
- ✅ Open firewall rules for GitHub's IP ranges
- ✅ Use GitHub's IP address list: https://api.github.com/meta

#### Issue 2: Different Nginx Paths
**Problem:** 
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` uses `.docker/nginx/ssl/`
- `docker-compose.production.yml` uses `./nginx/ssl/`

**Solution:** 
- ✅ Create both directories OR
- ✅ Standardize on one path

---

## 🚀 Recommended Workflow for NOW

### Phase 1: Manual Deployment (Current)

1. ✅ Use `docker-compose.prod.yml`
2. ✅ Deploy manually on VM
3. ✅ Test everything works

### Phase 2: Enable Automation (Later)

1. Set GitHub secrets
2. Create `./nginx/` directory structure to match production compose file
3. Test automated deployment workflow
4. Enable automatic deployments

---

## 🔍 Workflow File Locations

| File | Path | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Deploy | `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` | Auto-deploy to VM |
| Build | `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` | Build Docker images |
| Release | `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Create versioned releases |

---

## 📝 Recommendations

### Immediate (For Current Deployment):

1. ✅ **Keep workflows as-is** - they're for future automation
2. ✅ **Deploy manually** using `docker-compose.prod.yml`
3. ✅ **Don't set GitHub secrets yet** - not needed for manual deployment

### Future (After Successful Manual Deployment):

1. ⏭️ Set up GitHub secrets (PROD_HOST, PROD_USER, PROD_SSH_KEY)
2. ⏭️ Test network connectivity from GitHub runners to VM
3. ⏭️ Consider self-hosted runner if network blocked
4. ⏭️ Align nginx paths between compose files
5. ⏭️ Enable automated deployments

---

## 🎯 Action Items

### Now:
- [x] Keep workflows as-is (they're fine for future)
- [ ] Deploy manually to VM using `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- [ ] Test application works

### Later:
- [ ] Set GitHub secrets for automated deployment
- [ ] Test GitHub Actions can reach VM
- [ ] Set up self-hosted runner if needed
- [ ] Enable automated deployments

---

## 💡 Quick Fixes for Workflows (Optional)

### Fix 1: Add Comment to deploy-production.yml

Add a note that this workflow is for future use:

```yaml
# Note: This workflow is configured for automated deployment
# For initial deployment, use docker-compose.prod.yml manually
# See DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md for manual deployment guide
```

### Fix 2: Update docker-publish.yml Summary

The workflow already provides good deployment instructions. Consider updating to mention manual deployment option.

---

## ✅ Summary

**Your workflows are well-configured and ready for future automation!**

**For NOW:**
- ✅ Workflows are fine, keep them
- ✅ They build images automatically (useful for future)
- ✅ Deploy manually for first time
- ✅ Enable automation later

**Your deployment strategy is solid:**
1. **Now:** Manual deployment with `docker-compose.prod.yml`
2. **Future:** Automated deployment with `docker-compose.production.yml` + GitHub Actions

---

**Status:** ✅ Workflows are production-ready, configured for future automation
**Action:** Proceed with manual deployment for now
